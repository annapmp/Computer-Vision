# Computer-Vision
The Computer vision method that can be used to determine age of a person from a photo.

## Project description
The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. 
We are asked to conduct that evaluation.

The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol.
Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo.
The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age.
To start working on the task, we'll have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated.

## Project Steps

- Perform exploratory data analysis to get an overall impression of the dataset.
- Train and evaluate the model
- Make conclusions of the model evaluation
